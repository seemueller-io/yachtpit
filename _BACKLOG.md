## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Icon Design Consistency** - Risk of inconsistent visual style across 100+ icons
   - *Mitigation:* Create comprehensive style guide and icon templates
   
2. **Performance Impact** - Large number of icons may affect rendering performance
   - *Mitigation:* Implement icon atlasing and lazy loading
   
3. **Asset Loading Time** - Extensive icon set may increase initial load time
   - *Mitigation:* Progressive loading and asset compression

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Cross-platform Icon Rendering** - Icons may render differently across platforms
   - *Mitigation:* Test on all target platforms early
   
2. **Memory Usage** - Icon textures may consume significant memory
   - *Mitigation:* Optimize icon sizes and use appropriate formats

## Notes for Development

## Personal Development Notes

### Current State Analysis
- **Strengths:** Solid Bevy/Rust foundation, comprehensive component structure in player.rs
- **Gaps:** Missing icon assets, limited TextureAssets configuration, no icon management system
- **Opportunities:** Leverage existing YachtData structure, build on established plugin architecture

### Personal Development Approach
1. Start with core navigation icons (US-001) as foundation
2. Establish icon loading and management patterns early
3. Implement status indicator system for immediate visual feedback
4. Build comprehensive testing as icons are added
5. Focus on performance optimization throughout development

### Resources & Tools Needed
- Icon design resources (icon library or design tools)
- Asset optimization tools for performance
- Performance profiling setup for benchmarking
- ~~Testing setup for cross-platform compatibility~~ This is done in CI.
