# yachtpit/crates/systems
This crate provides Bevy-based systems and logic for yachtpit.

## Overview
The `systems` crate contains the core systems and logic built on top of Bevy's engine. 
It depends on the `components` crate and extends it with domain-specific systems, behaviors, and randomization utilities.

## Usage
This crate is designed to be used internally within the yachtpit project and is not published to crates.io. It provides the game systems layer that bridges the foundational components with the main application logic.
